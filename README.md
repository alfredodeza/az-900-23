## 💡 Create a study strategy
This repository has _my own notes_ but you should create yours as part of studying for the course. I show you how I did it below 👇

**Centralized details:** Certification https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900

* Download the skills outline

* Go through the 3 Learning Paths:

1. [Describe Cloud Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Describe Azure Architecture and Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-azure-architecture-services/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Describe Azure management and gobernance](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/describe-azure-management-governance/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)

Next, go through each Learning Path and create a markdown file for each that includes every learn module.

* Summarize

Sample repo structure:

```
.
├── 1-cloud-concepts.md
├── 2-core-services.md
├── 3-core-solutions.md
├── 4-security.md
├── 5-governance-compliance.md
├── 6-cost-management.md
└── README.md
```

1. Create a repository and add 6 markdown files, one for each section
1. Start summarizing, adding the Learning Path and Learning Module for each section
1. Capture services, definitions, and any key differentiators

Sample section:

```
## Main topic

### Service Name

Definition: Some definition

Features:

* Feature 1
* Feature 2
```

Find key differences for similar services. For example, IoT Hub vs. IoT Central:

**IoT Hub:** More control, less managed (no dashboard). Telemetry analysis.

**IoT Central:** Less control, more managed (dashboard included). Telemetry analysis.
