## 💡 Create a study strategy
This repository has _my own notes_ but you should create yours as part of studying for the course. I show you how I did it below 👇

**Centralized details:** Certification https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900

* Download the skills outline

* Go through the 6 sections:

1. Describe core Azure concepts
1. Describe core Azure services
1. Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure
1. Describe general security and network security features
1. Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features
1. Describe Azure cost management and SLAs


* Summarize

Sample repo structure:

```
.
├── 1-cloud-concepts.md
├── 2-core-services.md
├── 3-core-solutions.md
├── 4-security.md
├── 5-governance-compliance.md
├── 6-cost-management.md
└── README.md
```

1. Create a repository and add 6 markdown files, one for each section
1. Start summarizing, adding the Learning Path and Learning Module for each section
1. Capture services, definitions, and any key differentiators

Sample section:

```
## Main topic

### Service Name

Definition: Some definition

Features:

* Feature 1
* Feature 2
```

Find key differences for similar services. For example, IoT Hub vs. IoT Central:

**IoT Hub:** More control, less managed (no dashboard). Telemetry analysis.

**IoT Central:** Less control, more managed (dashboard included). Telemetry analysis.
